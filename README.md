# Hi there, I'm a Data Scientist at Dataeaze üëã

## üî≠ Cool Projects I've Worked On

### **[Complieaze - LLM-based Regulatory Compliance Assistant](https://complieaze.ai/)**
- **Description**: A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based assistant designed to handle diverse compliance use cases.
- **Key Achievements**:
  - Developed a RAG-based assistant integrating API-based models like GPT-4 and deploying fine-tuned models (SLMs) on-premise for cost-effective, customized solutions.
  - Worked on fine-tuned multimodal models to support scanned documents and image-based retrieval, enabling comprehensive compliance analysis across text and visual data.
  - Optimized on-premise fine-tuned models to reduce dependency on external APIs, achieving significant cost savings while maintaining high performance.

### SQLEaze -Text-to-SQL LLM for Data-Driven Decision Making
- **Tech Stack**: RAG, Hugging Face, LoRA, QLoRA, AutoTrain, Python, GPT-4, Prompt Engineering, Knowledge Distillation
- **Key Achievements**:
  - Built a tool that converts natural language queries into SQL statements, enhancing productivity and data-driven decision-making.
  - Pre-trained non-code-based LLMs to understand SQL contexts and fine-tuned models like LLaMA3, CodeLlama, and StarCoder using advanced techniques such as QLoRA/LoRA and PEFT for optimized inference and accuracy.
  - Used a multi-agent, actor-critic framework and AutoGen/langgraph to iteratively improve query accuracy, while generating synthetic data for fine-tuning the SQL Language Model (SLM).
  - Achieved over 90% accuracy on client-specific databases, significantly improving productivity and decision-making efficiency.
  - üì¶ **Check it out**: [One of my fine-tuned models is live on HuggingFace‚Äî1,000+ downloads and counting!](https://huggingface.co/dataeaze/dataeaze-text2sql-codellama_7b_instruct-dzsql)

### **Smart CCTV**
- **Description**: AI-powered enhancements for CCTV systems providing live security alerts, computer vision on edge devices, privacy-preserving algorithms, and federated learning.
- **Key Achievements**:
  - **Model Development**: Created models for person detection, re-identification, action classification, and depth estimation. Leveraged contrastive and SimCLR losses for unsupervised pre-training and supervised fine-tuning of person re-identification models.
  - **Pipeline Development**: Built an end-to-end pipeline using C++ with multithreading, asynchronous coroutines, and buffers (using Folly and ZeroMQ). Designed a simple GUI with QT Creator.
  - **Optimization**: Deployed deep learning models on edge devices (Jetson Devices) for real-time performance with high accuracy and low RAM usage. Techniques used included pruning, TensorRT, and Torch-TensorRT, along with indexing methods for re-identification similarity search optimization.
